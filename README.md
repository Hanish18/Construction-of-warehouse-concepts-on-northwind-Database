# Construction of warehouse concepts on northwind Database
 
 
 #When we are dealing with products we know that there exists a life cycle chain of products starting from the manufacturing and ending till it is received by the customers. Once an order is placed by the customer and the process that occurs till order is received is all maintained as a Supply chain process. For this we are using data warehousing concepts where we will store all the data related to this process and take only the data from which we can gather important information. Once we apply these concepts we can have reporting and visualisation by using different tools and technology.
